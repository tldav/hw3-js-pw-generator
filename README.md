Random Password Generator

Upon button press, the user selects character types to include or exclude. Character selection: lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, symbols. The user then selects the amount of characters between 8 and 128 characters.

Javascript selects random characters amongst the selected character types and creates a password in the amount of characters selected.

The password is displayed to the user.

The user has the option to copy to the clipboard with a button press. The user is alerted when the password is copied.

If the user selects no character types, a password is not generated. If the user enters non-numeric characters or numbers not between 8 and 128 for the password length, a password is not generated.

Includes obscure homestarrunner reference.
